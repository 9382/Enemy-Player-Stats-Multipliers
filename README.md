Visit the home page for more info on how to set up your configuration file!

Update 1.0.1: Fixed items not being considered for player changes, they are now multiplied correctly.

Update 1.0.0: RELEASE. also concatenated the multiple config files in one.

Update 0.9.5: Thanks to JopoJelly, added player health & mana modifiers.

Update 0.9.4: removed specific per mod per boss modifiers too much support.

Update 0.9.3: removed scaling for non-boss, it was causing AI problems for some entities.
 scaling for boss is still here use at your own risk.

Update 0.9.2: removed non boss only knockback modifier, boss & global are enough, can divide if needed.

Update 0.9.1: Fixed global stats. a lot of entities were NOT affected by the changes due to the way they were implemented in game.
This should now be completely fixed. HOWEVER when using cheatsheet NPC browser tool. the values shown in the interface do not correspond. spawning should work fine either way. Thanks to Mirsario for the help.

Update 0.9.0: Forked from compa's work on enemy stats config.
version number pushed back
